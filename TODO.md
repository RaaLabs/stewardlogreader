# TODO

- With reply messages, check if it is also registered as locked in the map, if it is not just delete it since it must have been a previous copy that was not finished.
- When the reader is restarted we should check if there already are existing reply messages in the folder for previously restarted copy process, and we should check if they actually finished......if possible.
- Add metrics.
- Add a version flag.
